# load dataframe
# load time_series_model
# load vu's model

# df = load_df() # returns the Dataframe with the Headlines AND sentiments

# t_s_model = load_model('time_series')
# vu_model  = load_model('nlp') 
# load model is a function that loads the given model and returns it
# a string is given (either 'time_series' or 'nlp') depending on which the right model gets returned (if clause in function)

# get_proba_vu(headline, vu_model) -> returns probability of stock going up or down (Vu's model)

#get_proba_t_s(day, t_s_model) -> returns probability of stock going up or down (from time series model)

# show Headline of given Date
# maybe show sentiments
# show probability of stock going up or down from Vu's model
# comparing to time series 
# comparing to what actually happened (Big Red or Green letters depending on outcome)
